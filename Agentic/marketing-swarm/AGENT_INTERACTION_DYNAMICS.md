## Typical Conversation Pattern

    participant Sarah as Sarah (Idealist)
    participant Marcus as Marcus (Data)
    participant Elena as Elena (Creative)
    participant David as David (UX)
    participant Priya as Priya (Analytics)
    participant Alex as Alex (Growth)
    
    Note over Sarah: Phase 1: Discovery
    Sarah->>Sarah: "Let's position as 'Intelligent Alternative'"
    
    Marcus-->>Sarah: [interrupting] "Stop! Premium is dead!"
    Note over Marcus: High assertiveness triggers interruption
    
    Elena-->>Marcus: [talking over] "You're both thinking too small!"
    Note over Elena: High contrarianism challenges both
    
    David->>Elena: "Rebellious financial advice? Users want security!"
    Note over David: User advocacy conflicts with risk
    
    Note over Priya: Phase 2: Analysis
    Priya->>Elena: "Numbers on 'rebellious' brands are terrible"
    Note over Priya: Data-driven skepticism
    
    Alex->>Priya: "While we debate, competitors launched!"
    Note over Alex: Growth urgency creates tension
    
    Sarah->>Elena: "Wait, what if rebellion + trust framework?"
    Note over Sarah: Synthesis attempt
    
    Marcus->>Sarah: "NOW we're talking! Data shows..."
    Note over Marcus: Agreement when data supports

## Example Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Data Challenge
```
Sarah: "We should position as premium..."
Marcus: [interrupting] "Premium positioning shows 23% lower conversion!"
Sarah: "But brand equity studies indicate..."
Marcus: "Show me the ROI numbers!"
Priya: "Actually, segmented data reveals premium works for high-value cohorts"
Resolution: Tiered positioning strategy
```

### Pattern 2: The Creative Clash
```
Elena: "What if we made investing feel rebellious?"
David: "Users lose money with 'rebellious' UX patterns"
Elena: "Not rebellion in execution, rebellion in messaging"
Alex: "Robinhood proved controversial can drive growth"
Priya: "Until regulatory issues cost them $65M"
Resolution: Bold messaging with conservative UX
```

### Pattern 3: The Speed Debate
```
Alex: "Launch fast, iterate later!"
Priya: "Rushing leads to 3x higher CAC"
Alex: "But first-mover advantage..."
Marcus: "Data shows fast followers often win"
Sarah: "What if we're fast but strategic?"
Resolution: Phased rapid deployment
