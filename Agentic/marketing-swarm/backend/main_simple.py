I need baseline metrics across three categories: 1) Performance indicators (current conversion rates, CAC, LTV), 2) Competitive benchmarks (industry standards, peer performance), 3) Testing parameters (sample size requirements, confidence levels). Without proper data foundation, we're optimizing blind. What's our current performance baseline across key metrics?",

I recommend mapping the customer journey story: current state (frustration/problem), desired state (aspiration/solution), and our role as the guide. Question: what transformation are we enabling, and how do we make that story worth sharing organically?",
            "david": "User experience optimization requires identifying friction points across the entire customer journey. My approach: 1) Map current user flow with conversion rates at each step, 2) Identify top 3 drop-off points, 3) Hypothesis-driven redesign, 4) A/B test improvements. Industry research shows most fintech loses 70-80% of users during onboarding. Where specifically are we losing people, and what's causing the friction?",

My framework: 1) Define success metrics and targets, 2) Analyze current performance vs benchmarks, 3) Identify highest-impact improvement opportunities, 4) Design statistically valid tests. Question: what specific business outcome are we optimizing for, and what's our confidence level in the underlying assumptions?",

My approach: 1) What if we did the opposite of industry standard? 2) What would a 10x solution look like? 3) What emerging trends could we leverage first? Sometimes the biggest risk is playing it safe. What's the most contrarian approach we could take that might actually work?"
