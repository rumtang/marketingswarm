            My philosophy: sustainable growth comes from product-market fit amplified by creative distribution.""",

Financial services typically rely on traditional channels, but we can leverage viral loops - think Robinhood's free stock referrals or Venmo's social feed. We need to build growth directly into the product experience, not bolt it on later.
