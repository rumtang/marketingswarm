**Testing Strategy**:
```python
# tests/test_performance.py
async def test_bed_status_performance():
    """Ensure bed status API responds quickly"""
    start = time.time()
    response = await client.get("/api/bed-status",
                               headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
    duration = time.time() - start
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert duration < 1.0, f"Response took {duration}s, expected <1s"
    
async def test_cache_effectiveness():
    """Verify cache reduces LLM calls"""
    # First call - cache miss
    await client.get("/api/bed-status")
    
    # Second call - should hit cache
    metrics_before = await client.get("/metrics")
    await client.get("/api/bed-status")
    metrics_after = await client.get("/metrics")
    
    assert metrics_after["llm_calls"] == metrics_before["llm_calls"]

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Checklist

### Backend Not Accessible ("Failed to fetch")
1. **Check Docker Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps  # Should show all services "Up"
   docker-compose logs backend  # Check for startup errors
   ```

2. **Test Backend Directly**:
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   
   # Test auth endpoint
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "username=admin&password=admin123"
   ```

3. **Common Issues**:
   - Port 8000 already in use: `lsof -i :8000`
   - Docker not running: `docker ps`
   - Backend crashed: Check logs for Python errors

### Frontend Auth Issues
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Check `.env` file exists
   - Verify VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   - Restart frontend after env changes

2. **Browser Console**:
   - Check Network tab for failed requests
   - Look for CORS errors
   - Verify request URLs are correct

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   ```bash
   # Restart everything
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build
   
   # Clear browser cache
   # Open DevTools > Application > Clear Storage
   ```

## 🎭 Narrative-First Architecture

### Philosophy: AI-Powered Healthcare Simulation
The entire system is built on LLM-generated patient narratives. There is no "demo mode" - this IS how the system works. Every patient has a unique story, every event has context, and all agents operate within this narrative framework.

### Core Design Principles
1. **No Synthetic Data**: All patient data comes from the narrative engine
2. **Contextual Everything**: Every component knows the current story context
3. **Session Persistence**: Stories remain consistent within a session
4. **Graceful Generation**: If LLM fails, use cached narrative templates

### What Makes This Approach Superior
✅ **Always Impressive**: Every interaction showcases AI capabilities
✅ **Infinitely Scalable Stories**: Never run out of unique scenarios
✅ **Emotionally Engaging**: Users connect with patient stories
✅ **Naturally Coherent**: AI maintains narrative consistency
✅ **Demo-Ready Always**: No special mode needed for presentations

### Simplified Architecture Benefits
✅ **Single Codebase**: No demo/production split
✅ **Unified Testing**: Test the actual system, not a demo version
✅ **Clear Mental Model**: Everything is narrative-driven
✅ **Faster Development**: No duplicate features
✅ **Better User Experience**: Consistent behavior always

## 🤖 LLM Narrative Engine Architecture

### Core Concept
A dedicated service that maintains session state and generates contextually appropriate healthcare scenarios using LLM capabilities.

### Technical Design

```python
class NarrativeEngine:
    """
    Core data engine - replaces synthetic data generation entirely
    """
    def __init__(self, session_id: str):
        self.session_id = session_id
        self.hospital_context = self._generate_hospital_personality()
        self.patient_stories = {}
        self.event_history = []
        self.event_queue = asyncio.Queue()
        
    async def start(self):
        """Replace the synthetic HL7 generator"""
        # Generate initial patient load
        await self._populate_initial_patients()
        # Start continuous narrative event generation
        asyncio.create_task(self._narrative_event_loop())
        
    async def get_patient_data(self, patient_id: str) -> dict:
        """Primary interface for all patient data requests"""
        if patient_id not in self.patient_stories:
            self.patient_stories[patient_id] = await self._generate_patient(patient_id)
        return self.patient_stories[patient_id]
        
    async def _narrative_event_loop(self):
        """Replaces synthetic HL7 event generation with narrative events"""
        while True:
            # Generate events based on narrative arc
            event = await self._generate_next_narrative_event()
            await self.event_queue.put(event)
            await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(5, 30))  # Natural pacing
```

### Integration Points

1. **Replace generate_synthetic_hl7.py**
   ```python
   # OLD: Synthetic data generator
   # DELETE: data/generate_synthetic_hl7.py
   
   # NEW: Narrative engine startup
   # backend/app/narrative_engine.py becomes primary data source
   ```

2. **Update All Agents**
   ```python
   # Every agent gets narrative context
   class CapacityPredictor:
       def __init__(self, narrative_engine):
           self.narrative = narrative_engine
           
       async def predict(self, bed_status):
           # Predictions based on narrative arc
           context = await self.narrative.get_hospital_context()
           return self._generate_narrative_aware_prediction(context)
   ```

3. **Single Data Flow**
   - Remove all synthetic data generation
   - All data requests go through narrative engine
   - No flags, no modes, just narrative

### Example Generated Content

**Patient Story**:
```json
{
  "patient_id": "P2024001",
  "name": "Margaret Chen",
  "age": 67,
  "backstory": "Retired teacher, lives alone, daughter visits weekly",
  "admission_reason": "Fall at home, possible hip fracture",
  "medical_history": ["Type 2 Diabetes", "Mild cognitive impairment"],
  "current_barriers": [
    "Awaiting PT evaluation",
    "Daughter traveling, return tomorrow",
    "Home safety assessment needed"
  ],
  "emotional_state": "Anxious about returning home alone"
}
```

**Contextual Event**:
```json
{
  "event_type": "Update",
  "narrative": "Mrs. Chen's daughter arrived early and arranged for grab bars installation. PT cleared for discharge with walker.",
  "impact": "Discharge barriers resolved, ready for afternoon discharge"
}
```

### Narrative Scenarios

The system naturally generates different narrative arcs based on time of day and session context:

1. **Morning Surge** (6am-10am sessions)
   - Natural ED admissions increase
   - Discharge planning challenges from overnight
   - Staff handoff complications

2. **Afternoon Complexity** (12pm-4pm sessions)  
   - Peak census management
   - Complex discharge barriers emerging
   - Resource allocation challenges

3. **Evening Transitions** (5pm-9pm sessions)
   - Shift change dynamics
   - After-hours discharge challenges
   - Emergency admissions

4. **Night Shift** (10pm-5am sessions)
   - Quieter pace with sudden emergencies
   - Reduced resources narratives
   - Critical care focus

No special configuration needed - the narrative engine naturally adapts to session time.

## 🧹 File Consolidation Requirements

### Files to DELETE Immediately
These duplicate files create confusion and must be removed:

**Backend Duplicates:**
- `backend/app/main_demo.py` - DELETE (consolidate into main.py)
- `backend/app/main_narrative.py` - DELETE (consolidate into main.py)
- `backend/app/agents/narrative_capacity_predictor.py` - DELETE (update existing capacity_predictor.py)
- `data/generate_synthetic_hl7.py` - DELETE (replaced by narrative engine)

**Frontend Duplicates:**
- Any components with "Demo" in the name should be integrated into main components
- Remove all `demoMode` flags and conditionals

### Files to KEEP and Update
- `backend/app/main.py` - Single entry point using narrative engine
- `backend/app/narrative_engine.py` - Core narrative system
- All original agent files (update to be narrative-aware)

### Consolidation Rules
1. **One Main, One Truth**: Only one main.py file
2. **No Mode Flags**: Remove all `if demoMode` conditionals
3. **Narrative by Default**: All data comes from narrative engine
4. **Delete First**: Remove duplicates before modifying originals

## ⚠️ Critical Implementation Details

### CSS/Tailwind Configuration Fix
**Issue**: `border-border` class not defined causing build failure

**Fix Required**:
```javascript
// In tailwind.config.js, add to theme.extend.colors:
border: 'hsl(var(--border))',
background: 'hsl(var(--background))',
foreground: 'hsl(var(--foreground))',
```

### Error Handling & Fallbacks
1. **LLM Failure Strategy**
   - Implement cached narrative templates
   - Pre-generate backup patient stories
   - Graceful degradation to template mode
   - User notification of degraded mode

2. **Fallback Implementation**
   ```python
   async def get_patient_data(self, patient_id: str) -> dict:
       try:
           return await self._generate_with_llm(patient_id)
       except Exception as e:
           logger.warning(f"LLM generation failed: {e}")
           return self._get_template_patient(patient_id)
   ```

### Session Management Specifications
1. **Session Persistence**
   - Sessions last 24 hours
   - Store in Redis or in-memory cache
   - Session ID in WebSocket connection
   - Survive page refreshes

2. **WebSocket Correlation**
   - Each WebSocket gets session ID on connect
   - Narrative engine maintains session state
   - Reconnection preserves narrative context

### Performance Considerations
1. **Pre-generation Strategy**
   - Generate initial 20-30 patients on session start
   - Background generation of upcoming events
   - Cache frequently accessed narratives

2. **Loading States**
   - Show skeleton UI while generating
   - "AI is creating patient story..." messages
   - Progressive narrative reveal

### Testing Strategy
1. **Mock LLM for Tests**
   ```python
   class MockNarrativeEngine:
       def __init__(self):
           self.templates = load_test_templates()
       
       async def generate_patient(self, bed_id: str) -> dict:
           return self.templates.get_deterministic_patient(bed_id)
   ```

2. **Test Coverage Requirements**
   - Narrative consistency within session
   - Fallback behavior when LLM fails
   - Session persistence across reconnects
   - Performance under load

- Backend requires JWT authentication on all endpoints
- Frontend doesn't send Authorization headers initially
- API URL mismatch: auth.js uses hardcoded 'http://localhost:8000' while App.jsx uses VITE_API_URL
- Possible CORS issues between frontend (localhost:5173) and backend (localhost:8000)
- Backend service may not be running or accessible
**Symptoms**:
1. First error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reduce')" - beds is undefined
2. After auth added: "Failed to fetch" - network request fails entirely
**Fix Required**:
- Fix API URL consistency across all files
- Verify backend is running (docker-compose ps)
- Check CORS configuration allows frontend origin
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Validate API responses before setting state
